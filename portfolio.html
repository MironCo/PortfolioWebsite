                    This was a cute, pixel art game I made in a few months.<br />
                    It taught me more about 2D game development and puzzle game design.<br />
                    While I thought it was pretty good, not many people played it.

                    A simple 2D game I made in 48 hours for the 2021 GMTK Game Jam.
                    I remember getting a very poor "fun" score, and I resolved to
                    create a game that was based on a good, FUN, central idea.

                    My third try at a horror game. This is the place where the Unity Game Engine clicked for me.
                    This game actually has a gameplay loop, and many moving parts. Made during quarantine.

                    A game made for the first and only Community Game Jam in 2019. In fact, it was the most popular game of the jam for a while.

                    The original "The Rocket Factory" game. It was very short, and I used really bad textures. But it was my first attempt at a horror game.
